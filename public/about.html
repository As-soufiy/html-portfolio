<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yakub Abdullahi Olamilekan As-soufiy. I’m an aspiring full-stack web developer with a deep passion for creating user-friendly websites and dynamic web applications. I'm currently focused on mastering frontend technologies while gradually diving into backend development to become a well-rounded software engineer.</p>
<p>I believe in growth — spiritually, creatively, and intellectually. As I learn web development from scratch, I also find joy in writing, poetry, and deep reflection on life. This portfolio marks the beginning of my tech journey. Every line of code is a step toward something meaningful. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I’ve enjoyed building it.</p>
